Real-time hand tracking using MediaPipe and OpenCV with landmark detection and FPS display

This project detects and tracks hands in real-time using MediaPipe's hand landmark model combined with OpenCV for video capture and rendering. It identifies key landmarks on the hand, highlights the thumb tips with circles, and draws a line between two thumbs if both hands are detected. The FPS (frames per second) is also displayed on the video feed.
